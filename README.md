# Btree #

An Btree library in C based on Btree algorithm published in Introduction to Algorithms (2nd edition), Cormen et al. p434.

I wrote this library as I wasn't able to find any 'easy-to-learn' code on Btrees online. The idea isn't to make this code fast and efficient, but to allow those who are interested to see how btrees can be implemented. I will be writing a blog post explaining the theory and walking through the key parts of the code - will post the link here :)

### How do I get set up? ###

To compile, run **make** in the 'tests' folder. This will compile the 'btree_test.c' file that uses the library to show how to:
* Create & populate a Btree
* Print the values in a Btree
* Search a Btree for a key
* Delete a key from a Btree

### Who do I talk to? ###
